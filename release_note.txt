3.2 (2013.05.10)

We're almost approaching the ultimate performance testing solution. 
We believe nGrinder 3.2 version is the most developer friendly performance testing tool ever.

- New feature and change
  * We support not only Jython as a script language but also Groovy + maven and JUnit styled test cases in 3.2. 
    It is the amazing approach which you can test and debug the test using your IDE such as eclipse.
    Check out TBD
  * IE 10 is supported. We added IE9 compatibility view option to show nGrinder correctly.
  * Graph fluctuation by nGrinder internal processing is reduced. Now you can see the more stabled graph.
  * The nGrinder usage is reported to our Google analytics. We only collect the controller IP and the count of performance test.
    If you don't like it, please set ngrinder.usage.report=false in system.conf
  * A User can specify the more detailed memory option by providing grinder.properties file as same folder of script.
  * SVN user can enjoy the user switching feature as well.
  * And.. several minor UI enhancements.


3.1.3 (2013.03.29)

We're proudly releasing nGrinder 3.1.3 which fixes bugs and visibility. 
This is the last version 3.1.X series, we'll work on 3.2 as a next release.
       
- New features and changes:
  * Now test report can be viewed without login.
  * A user can specify the sampling interval to make the graph not to be fluctuated.
  * A user can see the per test TPS chart when the sampling interval is greater than 2.
  * A user can upload and use native libs (so, dll) t o reuse existing assets. This is enabled only if the security mode is disabled.
  * A user can provide the any kind of custom value for monitor by regularly outputting the GC count and JVM memory usages.
  * A user can upload dll or so to run test using native libs. SecurityMode should be disabled and JNA should be imported for natvie lib access.
