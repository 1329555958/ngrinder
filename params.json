{"name":"nGrinder","body":"\r\n\r\nnGrinder \r\n========\r\n\r\nIt is the platform of stress tests which enables you to execute script creation, test execution, monitoring, and result report generator simultaneously. The opensource nGrinder offers easy ways to conduct stress tests by eliminating inconveniences and providing integrated environments.\r\n\r\nTo get started, checkout http://www.nhnopensource.org/ngrinder_document!\r\n\r\nnGrinder consists of two major components. \r\n\r\n* nGrinder controller is a web application which let performance tester create test script and configure test run\r\n* nGrinder agent is a virtual user generator which makes loads. \r\n\r\nCurrently nGrinder depends on CUBRID(http://www.cubrid.org) for database layer. \r\n\r\n* nGrinder is now being developed. It'll be released around October, 2012.\r\n \r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* Use Jython script to create scenario and generating stress in JVM. \r\n* Provide web-based interface for project management, monitoring, result management and report management. \r\n* Enable to monitor the state of agents generating stress and target machines receiving stress\r\n* Enable to inquire past test results by saving test history and provide absolute link to share with those who do not have private account. \r\n* Enable to converse image and csv from original results. \r\n\r\nQuick Start\r\n-----------\r\n* You can find out usage videos in the following location\r\n * http://www.youtube.com/user/ngrinderdev\r\n\r\n* You can also find the installation guide in the following.\r\n * http://www.cubrid.org/wiki_ngrinder\r\n\r\n* How to clone the repo \r\n * 'git clone git://github.com/nhnopensource/ngrinder.git'\r\n \r\nVersioning\r\n----------\r\n\r\nFor transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.\r\n\r\nReleases will be numbered with the follow format:\r\n\r\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\r\n\r\nAnd constructed with the following guidelines:\r\n\r\n* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)\r\n* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)\r\n* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch\r\n\r\n\r\nBug tracker\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nHave a bug or enhancement idea? Please create an issue here on GitHub if you want just notify to us! \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nhnopensource/ngrinder/issues\r\n\r\nOur official bug tracker is following.
